        <p>"Devon is a budding graphic design/marketing professional.
          <br><br>During his time with VIP Structures, Devon demonstrated proficiency in the Adobe Suite, web design, and social media to assist in our marketing goals. Coupled with his technical knowledge, Devon’s good attitude, ability to think outside the box, and eagerness to learn will bring him success in any professional environment."</p>

        <p>"I would recommend Devon Hardy based on his contributions and performance during his internship at VIP Structures with our marketing team. 
          <br><br>He was very easy to work with and had strong skills in many graphic design programs like Adobe Indesign and Photoshop. He developed his professional skills while working alongside other industry professionals in the office and was exposed to many different facets of marketing in our industry. During his time at VIP Structures, he assisted with social media campaigns, content creation, and web analytics."</p>

        <p>"I enthusiastically recommend Devon Hardy.
          <br><br>I’ve known Devon for over four years and I’ve worked with him extensively—first as my student and later as my TA— and in that time, I’ve found him to be an excellent student (top 1%) and watched him become a highly skilled designer and web developer. Moreover, Devon is dedicated, hard-working, committed to success, a superior collaborator, and an effective leader. He will be an asset to any team, at any level. Watching Devon teach himself web development (with a focus on core technologies), I saw him grasp concepts quickly and apply them in innovative ways. His ability to read, study, and recall information is superior, and his habits of practice help him both retain what’s he’s learned and adapt it to new situations.
          <br><br>As his professor, I had ample opportunity to observe his communication skills as well. Devon is an excellent writer and speaker and can express himself with precision and clarity. Devon is an inspired designer across different media. Whether it’s a webpage or application interface, a photo or illustration, video, or other document, Devon will invest the time and energy to solve the design problems in an aesthetically-pleasing way. His strong grasp of graphic design principles and typography further strengthen his communication skills, and his understanding of color, white space, proximity and layout make him an excellent UX and UI designer as well. He’s competent with a range of design software and platforms and I’ve seen him, more than once, learn new applications with alacrity and ease.
          <br><br>Devon will make an excellent addition to any communication-oriented design or development team. His intelligence, drive, passion, and empathy give his work clarity and force, and his willingness to learn and teach make him adaptable and well suited for a variety of roles."</p>
